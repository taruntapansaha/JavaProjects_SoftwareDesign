Assign2: Due 11:59PM March 10

Write a program, using test first development, for the problem described below. The program will read a file with airport codes. For example, the file may contain:
IAH
IAD
SFO
STL
BOS
MSP

For each given airport code, the program will fetch the airport name, the city name, state name, temperature, and if there is a delay or not, from http://services.faa.gov/airport/status/{CODE}?format=application/json
[replace {CODE} with an airport code, for example
http://services.faa.gov/airport/status/IAH?format=application/json
to get data for the airport code IAH]

The program will print, in sorted order of city name (if two cities have the same name, then the data is further sorted on state name), the following details: city | state | airport code | airport name | temperature | delayed or --- (--- for no delay).

The program will also print, below the table, one line
Number of airport delays: #

(where # is the actual number of delays).

If for some reason the details for an airport could not be obtained, then the row for that should be shown with --- for all data that could not be obtained for that airport code (but the airport code itself will be displayed on the row).
